This Julia script (MarketBigPictureWatch_run.jl) downloads key economic and market data from Fred, Yahoo, and Quandl.

Plots are generated using these data and PyPlot to show big pictures to show how things are going, particularly in the US.

Requires Julia 1.x. 

An environmental variable QUANDL_API_KEY must be set with the Quandl API key before running. (Get your API key by signing up for a free account at https://data.nasdaq.com.)
