This Pyton (MarketBigPictureWatch.py) downloads key economic and market data from Fred, Yahoo, and Multpl. 
(Note that Quandl free data is essentially unusable after being acquired by NASDAQ.)

(The Julia script (MarketBigPictureWatch_run.jl) is not maintained anymore but kept for backup.)

Plots are generated using these data and PyPlot to show big pictures of how things are going economically, particularly in the US.
